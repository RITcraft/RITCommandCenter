## What is it?

RITCommandCenter is a free and open-source Spigot plugin that provides useful information and functionality
specific to the Rochester Institute of Technology for players. Some of its existing features are to query a
web page for what dining areas are open and closed and to make Ritchie ocelots a real thing.

More to come in the near future.


## Who made it?

This plugin is provided by the [RITcraft](http://rit.j-f.co) community. The `/rit food` command was created
by [Chris Bitler](https://github.com/Chris-Bitler/).
